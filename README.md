# Prayer Flick Graph Plugin

This plugin helps the user with their timing by plotting their inputs against the game ticks. The vertical lines represent game ticks, the green points represent activating a prayer, and the red points represent deactivating a prayer. Works with either quick prayers or directly clicking a prayer within the prayer window. The colours of the graph can be customised via the plugin settings.
